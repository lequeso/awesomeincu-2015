Do you have a student at home who spends plenty of time on the computer, plays lots of Minecraft, or has enjoyed doing the Hour of Code at school? The After-School Coding Club is the place to take that interest in technology, and turn it into a productive skill. Designed for boys and girls ages 9 - 13 who want to try out programming, the Coding Club is a fun way to learn to code in a social, after-school setting.

The After-School Coding Club meets one night a week for 90 minutes, and new sessions begin each month during the school year. Come back for as many sessions as you'd like, the fun and the knowledge keep on building. Sign up with friends, or meet new people with similar interests. No prior programming experience is required, but students should be comfortable typing and using a web browser.

## After-School Coding Club Outcomes:

* Learn the basics of Computer Science
* Create your own programs using JavaScript
* Meet other students learning to code
