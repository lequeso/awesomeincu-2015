The Web Developer Bootcamp is a 3-month, full-time training program for aspiring web developers. We've worked with companies throughout the region to design a curriculum to prepare you to dive into a career in web development. This intense training program is designed to quickly take you from the basics of programming to a level of competency in building modern web applications. With over 500 hours of hands-on training, you'll gain experience while building 10+ projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Angular.js, AWS, GitHub, Agile, and more.

At the conclusion of the program, participants will be ready to interview with a number of our employer partners for the opportunity to earn a full time position in Kentucky at a competitive junior developer's salary.
