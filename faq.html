        <p>All of the courses require that you have basic experience using a computer to input text and manipulate graphics.  All courses also require you to have the ability to work productively for about 6 hours/day in a social, experiential learning environment.</p>

This enables you to go home after the course with a working development environment and continue working on your website, mobile app, or video game. If you do not have access to your own computer, we have a limited number of <a href="http://mkt.com/awesome-inc/laptop-rental">laptop computers for rent for $25/day</a>.</p>
