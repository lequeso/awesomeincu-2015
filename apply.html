    Multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. i now issue a new commandment: thou shalt do the dance. well, what is it today? more spelunking? cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. boxing is about respect. getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. mister wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to lie. but don't think of me as an idiot. i once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. only perfect intentions. i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. no, this is mount everest. you should flip on the discovery channel from time to time. but i guess you can't now, being dead and all. rehabilitated? well, now let me see. you know, i don't have any idea what that means. that tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. it only took me six days. same time it took the lord to make the world.
