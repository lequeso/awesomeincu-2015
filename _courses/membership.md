Learning to code can be intimidating on your own. Maybe you’ve gotten started on Codecademy, but never finished that JavaScript track. Perhaps you’ve dabbled in iPhone app development, following a series of video tutorials, but got stuck somewhere between Objective-C and an NSObject. If you’re looking to make a career switch, or just want to learn a valuable new skill, the Awesome Inc U Membership program is made for people like you.

The Membership is our training program for adults who are learning software development. It meets one evening per week, with joining windows each month. No prior programming experience is required. Our Members come from a variety of backgrounds, including design, healthcare, and finance.

<p class = "lead">"I particularly enjoyed the set-up of the Awesome Inc U Membership. Unlike other traditional methods of learning programming, Awesome Inc was flexible enough to let me choose a project I found interesting and relevant to my goals. By providing teaching assistants that I could go to when I needed help, I was able to go at my own pace and self-direct my learning without being overwhelmed by the roadblocks I ran into along the way. I would recommend Awesome Inc to anyone looking to gain some experience with programming."</p>

During Membership sessions, our team of coding coaches can help assess your current skill level, find a project or curriculum to study, and help you with questions and insightful tips along the way. Our Members work on a breadth of topics, from Ruby on Rails web development, to Android mobile development, to Data Science with the R language. In addition to 2 in-class hours per week, our coaches are available remotely via Slack online chat.

Membership outcomes:

* Accountability for setting and achieving your goals
* Complete a programming project in your language of choice
* Meet other adults learning to code
* Find out about tech job opportunities
