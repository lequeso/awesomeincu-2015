			<p>"Good introduction to Android programming for both new and experienced programmers. The instructors were very knowledgeable, willing to answer any questions, and intent on making sure everyone understood the concepts behind the coding. The pace of the class was ideal as each new topic built upon the last. As a result, I have a much more confidence in doing mobile development on my own. I would recommend this class for anyone looking to develop coding skills that are in high demand. I plan on signing up for the more of these classes in the future." <strong>-Robert B.</strong></p>

			<p>"I particularly enjoyed the set-up of the Awesome Inc U Membership. Unlike other traditional methods of learning programming, Awesome Inc was flexible enough to let me choose a project I found interesting and relevant to my goals. By providing teaching assistants that I could go to when I needed help, I was able to go at my own pace and self-direct my learning without being overwhelmed by the roadblocks I ran into along the way. I would recommend Awesome Inc to anyone looking to gain some experience with programming." <strong>-Jennifer Wu</strong></p>

			<p>"This was a fantastic course and I'd highly recommend taking it. The Awesome Inc. team kept a seemingly tedious subject fun and interesting with games, jokes and sandbox time. It was a very hands on class and by the end, we had built an actual website from scratch. They're not just blowing smoke -- Awesome Inc. really is awesome!" <strong>-Chelsea Nicole Stamper</strong></p>

			<p>"I've always wanted to learn how to code but thought it would be too hard. I feel like a coding guru after taking just a few Ainc U courses. The hands-on approach makes learning how to code easy." <strong>-David B.</strong></p>

In a world where coding jobs are plentiful, I now feel confident in my ability to create a basic web site with a hope to further develop my web development skill in the future." <strong>-Ben Childress</strong></p>
